# cell-neuclei-image-segmentation

This project implements a deep learning model for segmenting nuclei in cell images. This segmentation is crucial for various medical applications, such as cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The system leverages the U-Net architecture, known for its effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation tasks.

# # Key Features:

* U-Net Architecture: Employs a U-Net model for accurate nuclei segmentation.
* Image Preprocessing: Includes potential image augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
* Binary Segmentation: Segments nuclei as foreground objects and background.
* Evaluation Metrics: Employs metrics like accuracy and potentially Intersection over Union (IoU) to assess model performance.
* Model Saving: Saves the trained model for future use.

# # Prerequisites:

* Python 3.x with TensorFlow 2.x and Keras installed.
* Required libraries: os, keras, tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib, datetime, cv2, etc. (refer to the provided code for exact requirements).

# # To Run:

1. Data Preparation:
   * Organize your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Ensure images are in a compatible format (e.g., PNG, JPG) and masks are grayscale representations of nuclei regions.
2. Execute the Script: Run the provided Python script (*.py).
3. View Results:
   * Training logs might be visualized in TensorBoard (refer to script for details).
   * The script will evaluate the model's performance on the test set and display sample predictions.

# # Customization:

* Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, etc.) for potentially better performance.
* Explore image augmentation techniques (flipping, rotation) to enhance modelgeneralizability.
* Consider incorporating more sophisticated evaluation metrics (e.g., Dice coefficient) for a more comprehensive assessment.
# # Getting Started:

* Modify data paths in the script if your dataset structure differs.
* Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model for your specific dataset.
 # # Note:

This is a high-level overview. Refer to the script for detailed implementation and potential areas for further exploration.
